Installation
=============

Installing larigira is quite simple. You can install latest version from PyPI
using ``pip install larigira``. Or you can ``git clone
https://github.com/boyska/larigira.git`` and run ``python setup.py install``.
As always, the usage of a virtualenv is recommended.

The only supported python version is 2.7.
